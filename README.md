# **COMMAND SYSTEM**
A custom educational computer was developed based on the von Neumann architecture, with a set of instructions designed and implemented to enable input and output of data, perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder calculation), as well as other commands to transfer data between memory locations, among other functions. All instructions execute sequentially, except for conditional and unconditional branching instructions, which can modify the program flow. Each instruction takes two operands (memory addresses) as inputs, and for arithmetic instructions, the result is stored in a memory location specified by one of the operands. The computer's memory consists of 512 lines with addresses ranging from 1 to 512.

A table is provided below with the implemented instructions, their corresponding mnemonic codes, and a brief description of their functions:

# **REGISTERS AND FLAGS**
The current instruction in the machine is executed using operands stored in registers, which are categorized as RK, R1, R2, and RA based on their logical interpretation. RK represents the current command, RA represents the address number of the current line, and R1 and R2 are the operands on which the instruction is executed.

The ùúî flag, also known as "omega," changes based on the result of arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. It is used for conditional transitions and has a value of 0 if the result of the operation is zero. If the result is less than zero, the flag is set to 1; if greater than zero, it is set to 2.

Other flags include S, which represents the result sign, C, which represents the sign of the transfer from the higher order, T, which is a step-by-step mode flag (for debugging), and Z, which represents a zero-result flag used in conditional transitions.

In case of an error during program execution, the Err flag is raised and its value changes from 0 to 1, causing the program to crash.

All registers and flags are accessible through the GUI form panel, providing complete information about the current command and its operands during machine execution in debug mode.

# **IMPLEMENTATION OF EDUCATIONAL** **MACHINE**
**TOOLS**

The emulator for the two-address learning machine was developed using C# programming language and the Microsoft WPF .Net Framework, which is a framework for building graphical user interfaces for Windows operating systems. The project was created in the Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 integrated development environment.

**GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE**

The graphical user interface (GUI) of the educational machine is designed to simplify its use. It includes several functional elements, which are numbered in the screenshot of the main window.

***Picture 1**. Graphical user interface*

1. The program code table allows users to enter and edit commands for the learning machine. This table supports both integer and real numbers as inputs. If the user enters incorrect data, the diagnostics window will display an error message upon program start.
2. During program execution, the user may be prompted to enter data via a pop-up window. Users can enter integer or real numbers using the keyboard. If an incorrect value is entered or the user cancels the input operation, an error message will be displayed in the diagnostics window. Otherwise, the entered value will be displayed in the "Input" window.
3. The "Output" window displays the integer or real number generated by the program.
4. The registers and flags panel displays the current values of these components during program execution. In step-by-step mode, this panel provides a clear demonstration of the program execution process.
5. The "Diagnostics" window displays any warnings, remarks, or unexpected situations that may occur during program execution.
6. The panel displays the path to the open file.
7. The top of the window contains several auxiliary and control buttons, including "Save", "Save as", "Open", "Help", and "Cleaning". The "Run" button runs the program without debugging, the "Start debugging" button starts a step-by-step program run, the "Step" button goes to the next command, and the "Finish debugging" button ends the step-by-step program run.

## **CALCULATION USING CYCLES**
In order to explore the potential of implementing cyclic calculations, we will develop a program that utilizes loops and control structures. This program will be compiled and executed using the newly created learning machine emulator. By doing so, we can assess the emulator's ability to handle iterative computations and further validate its capabilities.

Task #2: calculate the value of the expression (wolfram alpha math input) y = Product[i^3 / (a - b), {i, 1, n}] with the values ‚Äú*a‚Äù* and ‚Äúb‚Äù specified by the user, if a != b, or calculate the value of the expression (a - b) / (a + b) if a = b.
